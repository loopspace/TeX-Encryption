%% This second machine below will be used to decrypt the string. It is
%% initialized with exactly the same settings as the first one. The
%% reason for this is that we can’t reuse the “encryption” machine as it
%% will already have progressed to some later state after the
%% encryption. Applying it on the ciphertext would yield a totally
%% different string. Hence the need for another machine.
